This GitHub repository will serve as both a catalog and representation of my abilities.  Contained within are programs, files, and small video games that I've made
during my time at Jacksonville State University.  To quickly view a description or screenshots of the included files, read the Documentation.docx file provided.

To open or run these files, you will need the following software:

Unity3d - https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive
Gamemaker Studio - https://www.yoyogames.com/studio/download
Blender - https://www.blender.org/download/

Additionally, to see the results of any of the java programs, you will need to download and path the java jdk here:
